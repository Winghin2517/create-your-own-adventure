When you wake up, you're still in the strange room with marshmallows for walls.

1. There are strawberries close to you.
2. Strange flowers are opening and closing their petals.
3. A sweet sticky smell is coming from the door on the far side.
4. A small rabbit is wearing a suit on the right side of where you are sleeping.
